# Algorithmic Programming
All of my algorithmic programming competition code and preparation code.
Algorithmic programming is competitive programming where problems are 
solved by combining a variety of algorithms and techniques.

###Guide
* Most files have a link at the top, pointing to the problem
* USACO is a prestigious competition which can lead to qualification to the
US national team at IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)
* USACO files are coded by the letter 'U' + another letter signifying the
level. 'B' = Bronze, 'S' = Silver, 'G' = Gold, 'P' = Platinum
* PClassic is a biannual competition hosted by UPenn with a Novice and 
a Standard division
* ACC is just my school competitive coding club, they host a POTW (Problem of the Week)
for friendly competition and practice
